			<h3>Memory Game</h3>
			<p>In 2021 - 2022 I created a memory game using Python and Pygame as part of my Advanced Higher Project. This involved the full development cycle through design, development, testing, and evaluation. The final documentation was over 200 pages and was well reviewed by the SQA.<br>
			<br>The game featured a working main menu where you could customise your settings for accesibility and also features a leaderboard where players could compete and compare scores. The game followed a simple pattern of being shown various objects (power ups, grass or bombs) <br>
			from there the user had to remember where everything was an click it and once the level was over a larger level was then generated and the cycle was repeated.<br>
			score was calculated by time taken, how many squares were clicked and how many powerups were collected.

			it would take the files from a series of 3 dockers to simulates "folders" and would assemble the text from each file into a main text file where it would read as a coherent story. <br>
			The program offered additional functionality allowing the user to remove/add any text by searching through the file.

			for over 3 years I have received just a handfull of messages so clearly something isn't right. I created multiple versions orignally the program manually controlled your browser but this wasn't ideal if you wanted to use the computer <br>
			at the same time so a couple months later I managed to make it use the same api that the website uses so it now functions in the command prompt just like you are opening the website but without having to actually do anything.

				easy, medium or hard. Each AI used a different method for calculating attacks with easy just randomly selecting a square. Medium would randomly select until it hit 1 then it would hit squares near the first hit. Hard would use the same as medium but be on a larger board. 
				<br><br>
				The program was great fun to make and followed a simple main game loop for checking if all ships were destroyed.

			<p>The Source Game Engine utilises vbsp.exe to compile its maps however, the source engine has lots of different games all created at different points in time resulting in inconsistent <br>
			vbsp.exe values for example a game might support 60000 brushes in a map and be able to run it fine and another source game might only support 5000 and as such vbsp.exe will only allow you to compile for 5000 despite the game limit being 60000.
			<br>The only thing actually stopping vbsp.exe from running and compiling is just if statements in the code and all I did was use hxd and ghidra to look for lines related to brushes, vertexes and brushides and increase these limits <br>
			Then it all just seemed to work, but it was great fun looking for the code and finding and translating the positioning to hxd so I could edit it.
